/// A cache of fixed-size blocks of one file, the fallback below the prefetched
/// ranges: a read that no registered range covers is served here at block
/// granularity instead of being left to the caller, which would read it from the
/// underlying stream uncached and pay for it again on the next reader. It is a
/// general mechanism over the whole file - any reader, any offset, any round of
/// registered ranges - not a cache of one particular kind of read.
///
/// Blocks are aligned to the END of the file: block 0 is
/// [file_size - block_size, file_size). The reads served here concentrate at the
/// tail of a file: a reader reads the metadata of its file before it knows which
/// ranges to register, and every reader of the file reads the same bytes. End
/// alignment gives that region whole blocks - a read of the last block_size bytes
/// of a file is one block whatever the file size - and leaves the only partial
/// block at the head of the file. It also keeps every block inside the file, as
/// long as the given file size is the size of the file: a block fetch failing
/// because the file is shorter than that only costs the caching of that block,
/// see Read().
///
/// One block serves one read: a read longer than a block, or straddling two, is
/// declined and left to the caller instead of being fetched in pieces, so a
/// served read stays one block, one fetch and one copy.
///
/// A block is published before its fetch is dispatched, so concurrent readers of
/// the same block wait for that one fetch instead of issuing their own.
///
/// Blocks are never evicted: once the capacity is reached Read() declines
/// instead of replacing a block. That keeps every dispatched fetch reachable
/// through its block, so Release() and the destructor can wait for the fetches
/// still writing into the block buffers.
